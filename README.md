## Description

EA Frankenstein utilizes machine learning algorithms to make trading decisions based on price movements and predictions. The expert advisor opens buy or sell orders when certain conditions are met. It also includes a trade panel for advanced trade management.

## Input Parameters

- LotSize: The lot size for trading. Default value is 0.01.
- StopLoss: The stop loss in pips. Default value is 50.
- TakeProfit: The take profit in pips. Default value is 100.

## Global Variables

- `ticket`: The order ticket number.
- `tradePanelOpened`: A flag to check if the trade panel is already opened.

## Custom Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. It sets the optimization criterion, sets the currency pairs for the news filter, and checks the timeframe. It also initializes the trade panel if it is not already opened.

## Custom Indicator Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called during the deinitialization of the expert advisor. It closes the trade panel.

## Custom Indicator Start

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the market. It checks for a new bar on the M5 timeframe and gets the price channel and machine learning prediction. If the price is above the upper channel and the prediction is bullish, a buy order is opened. If the price is below the lower channel and the prediction is bearish, a sell order is opened. The function also checks for order close conditions and modifies the take profit level based on the profit factor.

## Helper Functions

- `isNewBar`: This function checks if a new bar has formed on the M5 timeframe.
- `getMachineLearningPrediction`: This function should be implemented to return the machine learning prediction as a double value.
- `getProfitFactor`: This function should be implemented to calculate the profit factor and return it as a double value.
- `OpenTradePanel`: This function should be implemented to open the trade panel with advanced trade management functionalities.
- `CloseTradePanel`: This function should be implemented to close the trade panel.

Please note that the actual implementation of the machine learning algorithm and profit factor calculation is not provided in this sample code. These functions should be implemented separately based on your specific requirements and trading strategy.
